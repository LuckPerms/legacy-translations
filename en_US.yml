  {PREFIX}&3It seems that no permissions have been setup yet!\n
  {PREFIX}&3Before you can use any of the LuckPerms commands in-game, you need to use the console to give yourself access.\n
  {PREFIX}&3Open your console and run:\n
  {PREFIX} &3&l> &a{0} user {1} permission set luckperms.* true\n
  \n
  {PREFIX}&3After you've done this, you can begin to define your permission assignments and groups.\n
